# On the Fundamental Nature of Neural-Type Computation

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have demonstrated the power of neural network-inspired models despite abandoning bio-realistic principles. However, their capabilities hint that intrinsic dynamics are being tapped into, which evolution exploited for biological cognition. We propose neural-type computation arises naturally from physical laws, not just precise biology.

Modern neural networks succeed despite substantial divergence from neuroscience. Fixed weights and backpropagation deviate enormously from the brain's constant flux, yet progress continues rapidly. This implies latent computational potentials are being accessed, though highly constrained.

A key factor in recent progress has been allowing weight motion during training. This better captures natural plasticity and neural excitation patterns. Emergent phenomena arise from nonlinear mixing and evolution of weights over many iterations.

The brain exhibits two key characteristics: dynamic activity propagating as resonant waves, and self-organization according to energetic and statistical principles. These relate closely to the non-locality and free energy optimization required for neural systems to emerge.

Electromagnetic influences within interacting neural fields could spontaneously induce collective oscillation patterns through interference. Evolution likely capitalized on this natural potential for complex signaling.

Likewise, the brain's adaptive resonance and development manifest as gradients on an energetic landscape. Neural systems spontaneously self-organize to statistically mimic sensory data through activity and plasticity.

Together, interference and free energy descent may be sufficient for neural-type information processing to emerge within any sufficiently complex, dynamic physical system. Evidence spans metallic nanowire networks to particle simulations exhibiting such phenomena.

In summary, core requirements are dynamicity and adaptive statistics, which arise naturally from physical principles. This conceptual unification promises more capable, generalizable artificial systems, while demystifying the origins of biological cognition. Ongoing interdisciplinary research will further illuminate these foundational insights.
